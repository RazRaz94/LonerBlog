This blog focuses on self-improvement activities and analysis that is related to my hobbies. You will find things like:

    Fighting Games activities depending on the sets
    Any tournament performance
    Speedrun statistics and analysis related to my latest personal best
    Any video game information that I find it interesting to talk about

It's also possible that I will be doing my own profession posting of web development depending on the project.

I usually stream my speedruns on twitch and upload necessary milestone or tutorials in YouTube.
