> I had almost forgotten about this blog, as I intended to update it weekly whenever I accomplished something. The great news is that I finally received a job opportunity focused on the networking field, and it appears that the first phase of the interview went well.

## Networking Operation & Understanding the Server

The company I have the opportunity with specializes in cutting-edge ICT and cybersecurity solutions, providing innovative and tailored services throughout the Middle East. However, after the interview, I realized that I need to brush up on my knowledge of servers and network operations. To prepare for this, I have to dive into a few key areas:
- **Understanding Server Architecture:** I’ll revisit the fundamentals of server architecture, including the different types of servers (such as web, application, and database servers) and their roles within a network.
- **Data Centers:** I plan to learn more about data center operations, including their design, management, and the technologies that support them. Understanding how data centers function and the role they play in hosting applications and services will be vital for my career in networking.
- **Networking Protocols:** Familiarizing myself with essential networking protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS will be crucial. I aim to understand how these protocols facilitate communication between devices.
- **Network Configuration and Management:** I’ll explore the basics of configuring and managing networks, including IP addressing, subnetting, and the use of routers and switches.
- **Virtualization and Cloud Computing:** Given the growing importance of cloud technologies, I plan to learn more about virtualization and how cloud services can enhance network operations. 
- **Security Best Practices:** Since cybersecurity is a key focus of the company, I’ll brush up on best practices for securing servers and networks against potential threats.

Of course these efforts will not only refine my skills but also boost my confidence as I pursue this job opportunity. If I come across any intriguing insights about specific applications, I’ll be sure to share them in my next post.

## Game Progress and the Indecision of Choosing Actions

Clearly, this is the primary focus at the moment, brusing aside my life progress. I do not only speedrun but I also try to improve fighting games with TEKKEN being my main game. Season 1 is ending soon and the highest progress I reached is [getting close to Tekken God Rank](https://razraz94.github.io/LonerBlog/post/Life-and-Games/images/Junka.jpg)

The problems that I keep facing is the days when I struggle to give my all or feel lazy. This significantly impacts my consistency. I believe the main reason for this is that I tend to focus on reading my opponents rather than concentrating on the situation, the punishments, and the matchups. Let's hope that we will improve a lot by the time season 2 drops.

Season 2 [first impression is not looking good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwfOye9X_uw). The fan's reaction of Season 2 reflects a mix of surprise and disappointment, as many expected a stronger defense. Instead, characters have demonstrated notable improvements in offensive. This led to fans feeling that the developers strayed from their inital focus. This resulted in frustration yet I see it as this seems made with the intent they're nerfing something. I still can't blame them because it was just a bad presentation of the information and no one should ever do this. 

## Speedrun Journey

Balancing between my time on fighting game and speedrun can be a big challenge. Ramadan schedule been hard but it becomes much harder once I hopefully get the job secured. Every day, I just fight myself on what I want to do and what I want to push. My current focuses are:
- **[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance](https://www.speedrun.com/mgrr?h=Any_NG-hard&x=vdo8mokp-5lymj2l4.013x8rr1)** - This was my project for a long time and it's long overdue to finally learn this game and get better at the New Game Category
- **[Onimusha Series](https://www.speedrun.com/series/onimusha)** - I have been playing Dawn of Dreams and 3rd game a lot more in prepration for GDQ Summer 2025 to showcase it's run and such. Onimusha 2 HD is also releasing soon which will be one of the toughest game to run in my opinion.
- **[Ninja Gaiden II Black](https://www.speedrun.com/NG2B)** - Same reason as Onimusha. Ninja Gaiden 4 is releasing soon and make sure the Ninja Gaiden Speedrun community get more flowers

As for Devil May Cry. I am not sure, because I feel that I reached into the point from that series where I have nothing else to prove. I can run and PB once in a while but I think completing the wiki project and keeping the resources up to date is far more important.

## Conclusion
I am excited about the job opportunity in the networking field, which will help me to enhance my knowledge of servers, data centers, networking protocols, and cybersecurity practices. This preparation not only aims to refine my skills but also to bolster my confidence as I navigate this new chapter.

I will continue to balance my passion for fighting games, particularly TEKKEN, with my speedrunning endeavors. While I face challenges in maintaining consistency and focus. The mixed reactions from the community highlight the importance of clear communication from developers, and I hope for a more balanced approach moving forward.

I wonder if its a good idea to add a section in this blog to move over [my speedrun database knowledge](https://bit.ly/srclhknowledge) here as well.
