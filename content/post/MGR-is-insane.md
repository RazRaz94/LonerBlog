MGR New Game Hard is easily one of the difficult speedruns in my experience, and it has left a lasting impression on me. There are only two games that have given me this feeling: one is Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, known for its preciseness combat, and the other is Ninja Gaiden Black, a title that redefined movement in action games.

Luckily, Metal Gear community has wealth of information available on their [Wiki resource](https://metalgearspeedrunners.com/wiki/doku.php?id=metal_gear_rising:revengance), along with the invaluable insights from [Mekarazium's documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZJDO1VWNWjrYd-poQbo4Ha_XcaNTZ0O45qFhpiYCrZo/edit?gid=556438614#gid=556438614), has greatly enhanced my understanding of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance runs.

## It may look like a breeze but the level of stress is undeniable 

Like many speedruns, many would say that this game is easy to pick up and run. Although, once you dive into the gameplay, the unpredictable behavior of the AI can make it quite frustrating to adapt. Metal Gear Rising stands out as one of the few movement-oriented games in its genre, which is why [NG+ is the most popular](https://speeddemosarchive.com/MetalGearRising.html). To provide some example and emphasize this 3 month of endeavor:

- Metal Gear Ray 1 is your major gate keeper because you have to pray that it gives you headbutt charge more often. You block them and counter attack for 20% and Light attack whenever possible.
- Monsoon unpredictable flowchart. Each attack has the capability of leading into every other attack that exists + itself. Adjusting his HP into certain point twice to skip the military vehicles throws is one of the most frustrating part of the rng. Usually for each attempt you can either lose a whole attempt for new PB or just have a large chunk of time save in that fight alone.
- JetStream Sam crash. If you'll be anywhere around rocks during the final cutscene, the game will likely crash it's a common place and the #1 reason you pay attention "where" you are during the fight, if you get a crash you're not going to be happy.

## Is it worth ?
Yes, the learning process was lengthy, but it ultimately provides a profound sense of satisfaction upon completing the run. I wanted to push this game as much as possible before Onimusha 2 Remaster release this week.

I want to run this game more in future, but for now this milestone is good enough to leave where at it. Resetting will be excessive and my [notes](https://bit.ly/42aWtVS) might need another update since I learned so much recently after going through [cramer YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoD3CAKWLWq1EBMPH7NBHmw).
