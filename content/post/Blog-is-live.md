## A new beginning

Lately, I have started having trouble storing the thoughts and notes that I have had since I started [DMCSpeedrun Wiki project](https://dmc.wiki) in 2021. At the same time, it's kind of healthy to let things out the moment they consume you in a bad way. It's one of those weird obsessions I have.

What is funny is this became more apparent when Twitter started to screw itself over and over again to the point where I had to start fresh in BlueSky. I am very fortunate that I won't have to go through the bad habit of scrolling through social timelines forever. Most of the time now, I go through messages in Discord, watch friends' Twitch, and play video games to gain information or improve what interests me.

## Devil May Cry & Speedruns

I invested time and blood in this series for a long time. My interest in this series re-ignited when DMC5 happened even though I was at my lowest point. My friends showcased me on how the speedrun works for this game and I started to get more curious in that perspective of style play. I thought that the community weren't getting along so well. This resulted in building the project that I mentioned above. I am at a point where I could ask for some volunteers and help from people who could update and maintain the contents of the wiki.

The one game that I invested the most is DMC2. Javelina Devil is the reason behind this as I keep chasing her to suprass by achieving Full S rank with both characters. She owns a [blog](http://devilishdesign.net/) where she showcases her design works and knowledge in the DMC series. On the other hand, we got DMC3, a beloved game by many. Possibly one of my proudest games due to [the record that I broke in 2021](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/949813936). I mentioned in the stream a couple of times that I am going to speedrun DMD at one point. This will be the focus as soon as I get new personal best in Ninja Gaiden Black and Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams.

The S rank idea reminds me of my high school hobby that during PS3-era I had [which is trying to 100% games including trophies](https://psntrophyleaders.com/user/view/tekkn6#games). I usually did that when I liked the game enough and find myself playing it again over and over.

## Fighting Games

There are only 3 games that interest me. Tekken, BlazBlue and DNFDuel. I am unsure of how and what kind of post I approach with this but, if there is something very valuable about my tournament run and such I probably would post something about it. However, the investment in these games is difficult because I have to balance my time between speedrunning and real-life match-ups.

Tekken 8 is currently my favourite fighting game of all time. I wish to be decent at that game.

## What I will be posting here and how often ?
- Depending on the milestone achieved I will make posts and tags related to X or Y games for my thought process. For example DMC2 S rank Mission 1: Key points / Ninja Gaiden Black: Key saves to achieve further milestones.
- It's possible that I am gonna go through this weekly.
- Naturally, it's very important to categorize these posts with tags. But, I also have to improve this site later by making users navigate the posts with ease.

As I post more, I will try to find a method where you could interact me here without in need of making account and such.
