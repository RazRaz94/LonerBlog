His game and influence had major impact when I was young. On my delusional age, I never really understood him and thought he was not a good guy till I played his games and understood him better.

Thanks to harada's latest story, it was super clear that all He never hold grudge during smack talk and such. He respects them. It's extremely depressing how he didn't get to make a comeback, and passed away before he was even 60. I was hoping he'd get the kamiya treatment from Team Ninja themselves and watch NG4 even but life can be so cruel at times.

## Introduction to his first game Ninja Gaiden

When my family got OG Xbox, we managed to play Soul Calibur 2 and Spikeout. Few weeks later, my uncle came with the first Ninja Gaiden vanilla version. The game looked a head of its time and I had fun watching him playthrough till he gave up on Alma boss. We never understood why. The same thing got repeated with the updated version (Ninja Gaiden Black).

When the second game got announced, I decided to look up more about the game before learning about YouTube and forums. I can't recall which year was that exactly but it was very interesting cause I had this strong determination to beat the game.

I have realised that the game mainly emphazises on movements and such instead of spear heading through the content which was unexpected from the most games. We never really cared about reviews or anything. We just judge the game by cover and have fun.

Fast forward to Xbox 360 release and asked my uncle whether he is going to buy Ninja Gaiden II. He said that we couldn't beat the first game so it's not worth it and I told him that I know how the game works now. As a result, he made a deal "If you want Ninja Gaiden II, you will need to beat Ninja Gaiden Black".

We never had any recording equipment or ever had intention to engage with the internet aside from just collecting MP3s or watch new game trailers from YouTube. My favourite memory during that playthrough is how my uncle usually turns up the volume on the TV whenever a good sound track comes out like the Monastary Altar.

Eventually, the game got beaten and so did the second game. Only Normal mode, we never really cared about extra content. Until I grew up and owned myself a Sigma version even though this was not itagaki game, back then my knowledge of developers background and such was still non-existant.

## Learning about Itagaki's History

Until like college days, this is where I decided to dig deep about the person behind the series. Time to time I enjoy re-watching his interviews. This one in praticular around 18:30 where he talks about his story of constantly watching Armageddon with his daughter moved me.

I got really sad upon learning the drama between him and tecmo over unpaid bonuses. Many are aware what the former vice president did. Although, he still left a legacy where Hayashi kept making Ninja Gaiden while Shimbori made DOA. He crystallized design of the enemies and how they can be interactive with the players.

## Encounters with the Community

Every game has great people behind it. Thanks to his games, I met great people behind it. My first encounter was TheGodfatherDictator at twitch, the interesting part is when he asked me if I knew his ID or encoutnered him somewhere which I believe that I did when I was looking around Ninja Gaiden videos from the forums and official medias at the Team Ninja website. However on my younger days ? I don't really know because I was too young back then to understand how internet and socializing works.

The fandom might be split in the half now with the upcoming Civil drama on NG4 but one esscence that is how the OGs of the fandom stick together such as the event of the 20th anniversary to meet up with people who loved his work and thrives that Team Ninja can do better by carrying on to his legacy.

I have made my own fair share of the online event participation with them such as Alma race, Eternal Legend tournament. I hope that one day we can redo the Official Master Ninja Tournament World Champion now that Insignia made those content accessible now through the emulator with the Original Ninja Gaiden.


## Closing statement

I have got so much on my mind running today but It's difficult time as one of younger day heroes went away. It is sad that he hadn't released new work after Devil's Third with his last words apologize for that, but his name definitely won't be forgetten and I am glad Team Ninja showed that gesture despite the bad blood he had with Tecmo. I hope he's at peace now.
