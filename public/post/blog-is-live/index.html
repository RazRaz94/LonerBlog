<h2 id="a-new-beginning">A new beginning</h2>
<p>Lately, I have started having trouble storing the thoughts and notes that I have had since I started <a href="https://dmc.wiki">DMCSpeedrun Wiki project</a> in 2021. At the same time, it&rsquo;s kind of healthy to let things out the moment they consume you in a bad way. It&rsquo;s one of those weird obsessions I have.</p>
<p>What is funny is this became more apparent when Twitter started to screw itself over and over again to the point where I had to start fresh in BlueSky. I am very fortunate that I won&rsquo;t have to go through the bad habit of scrolling through social timelines forever. Most of the time now, I go through messages in Discord, watch friends&rsquo; Twitch, and play video games to gain information or improve what interests me.</p>
<h2 id="devil-may-cry--speedruns">Devil May Cry &amp; Speedruns</h2>
<p>I invested time and blood in this series for a long time. My interest in this series re-ignited when DMC5 happened even though I was at my lowest point. My friends showcased me on how the speedrun works for this game and I started to get more curious in that perspective of style play. I thought that the community weren&rsquo;t getting along so well. This resulted in building the project that I mentioned above. I am at a point where I could ask for some volunteers and help from people who could update and maintain the contents of the wiki.</p>
<p>The one game that I invested the most is DMC2. Javelina Devil is the reason behind this as I keep chasing her to suprass by achieving Full S rank with both characters. She owns a <a href="http://devilishdesign.net/">blog</a> where she showcases her design works and knowledge in the DMC series. On the other hand, we got DMC3, a beloved game by many. Possibly one of my proudest games due to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/949813936">the record that I broke in 2021</a>. I mentioned in the stream a couple of times that I am going to speedrun DMD at one point. This will be the focus as soon as I get new personal best in Ninja Gaiden Black and Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams.</p>
<p>The S rank idea reminds me of my high school hobby that during PS3-era I had <a href="https://psntrophyleaders.com/user/view/tekkn6#games">which is trying to 100% games including trophies</a>. I usually did that when I liked the game enough and find myself playing it again over and over.</p>
<h2 id="fighting-games">Fighting Games</h2>
<p>There are only 3 games that interest me. Tekken, BlazBlue and DNFDuel. I am unsure of how and what kind of post I approach with this but, if there is something very valuable about my tournament run and such I probably would post something about it. However, the investment in these games is difficult because I have to balance my time between speedrunning and real-life match-ups.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 is currently my favourite fighting game of all time. I wish to be decent at that game.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-will-be-posting-here-and-how-often-">What I will be posting here and how often ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the milestone achieved I will make posts and tags related to X or Y games for my thought process. For example DMC2 S rank Mission 1: Key points / Ninja Gaiden Black: Key saves to achieve further milestones.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that I am gonna go through this weekly.</li>
<li>Naturally, it&rsquo;s very important to categorize these posts with tags. But, I also have to improve this site later by making users navigate the posts with ease.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I post more, I will try to find a method where you could interact me here without in need of making account and such.</p></article>
